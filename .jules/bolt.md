## 2026-02-20 - [Batch API Calls for Bulk Assignments]
**Learning:** Found a common anti-pattern where multiple homework assignments were being created in a sequential loop of `fetch` calls. This led to $O(N \times M)$ network requests (where N is students and M is exercises). By implementing a batch endpoint using Prisma's `createMany`, network overhead was reduced to $O(1)$ and database transactions were consolidated.
**Action:** Always check for `await fetch` inside loops, especially in dashboards or wizards where multiple items can be selected at once. Prefer batch endpoints and Prisma's `createMany` for bulk operations.
