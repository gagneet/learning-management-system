## 2026-02-19 - [Privilege Escalation & Input Validation in User Creation]
**Vulnerability:** A `CENTER_ADMIN` was able to create a `SUPER_ADMIN` user. Additionally, the API lacked validation for the `role` enum and the existence of the target `centerId`, leading to potential authorization bypasses and database constraint violations.
**Learning:** Security fixes must be holistic. While preventing privilege escalation was the primary goal, the absence of basic input validation for enums and foreign keys created secondary vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass logic or crash the service.
**Prevention:** Implement strict schema validation (using enums) and referential integrity checks at the API layer. Always validate that the requester has sufficient state (e.g., a valid `centerId`) before allowing them to delegate that state to others.

## 2026-02-21 - [Multi-tenancy Inconsistency and Info Disclosure]
**Vulnerability:** Tenancy helpers in `lib/tenancy.ts` used inconsistent property names (`centreId` vs `centerId`) when validating sessions, leading to potential functional breakage or logic bypass. Additionally, some API routes leaked raw `error.message` in responses, exposing internal details.
**Learning:** Inconsistent naming conventions (British vs American spelling) in a multi-tenant system are not just a developer nuisance but a security risk. If security utilities don't match the actual data structures (like the session object), they can fail or be bypassed. Standardizing these at the utility layer and hardening them to check for both variants is essential.
**Prevention:** Always verify that security helpers use the exact property names defined in the session/JWT interfaces. Harden input validation to check for all known variants of sensitive fields (e.g., `centerId` and `centreId`). Never return raw error messages to the client.

## 2026-02-23 - [Batch Operations and Tenant Isolation]
**Vulnerability:** Batch API endpoints (like `/api/academic/homework/batch`) often skip the granular validation found in single-resource endpoints. In this case, the batch homework API lacked checks to ensure that all students and courses in the request belonged to the user's center, enabling cross-tenant data injection (IDOR).
**Learning:** Performance optimizations like batching must not come at the cost of security. Validating unique IDs across multiple tables in a multi-tenant system requires careful use of `Promise.all` and set-based comparisons to remain efficient while maintaining isolation.
**Prevention:** Always implement a validation step for batch operations that verifies every provided foreign key belongs to the authorized tenant. Collect unique IDs and perform a bulk query (e.g., `findMany` with `in` filter) to verify ownership before proceeding with `createMany`.
