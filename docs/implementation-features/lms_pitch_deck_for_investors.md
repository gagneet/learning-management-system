# **Slide 2 — The Problem**

Tutoring centres today face major challenges:

- Fragmented systems for scheduling, payments, assessments, and communication  
- No unified platform for multi‑centre or multi‑region operations  
- Limited support for special‑needs learners  
- Poor integration with remote learning tools  
- Manual tutor‑student allocation leading to inefficiencies  
- Lack of real‑time analytics for student progress  
- No offline mode for low‑connectivity regions  
- Administrative overhead is extremely high  

Tutoring centres need a **single, scalable, intelligent platform**.

# **Slide 3 — The Opportunity**

The global tutoring market is growing rapidly:

- Rising adoption of hybrid and remote learning

There is **no unified LMS** built specifically for tutoring centres with:

- Multi‑centre management  
- Special‑needs support  
- Multi‑lingual instruction  
- Offline capability  
- Deep analytics  
- Integrated finance and operations  

This is a **massive gap**.
