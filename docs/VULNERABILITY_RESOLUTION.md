# Vulnerability and Deprecation Resolution Report

This document details the actions taken to resolve vulnerabilities and deprecation warnings in the Learning Management System project, as well as any issues that remain unresolved due to constraints (no overrides, no breaking changes).

## Resolved Issues

### Deprecated Packages
The following deprecated packages were removed or updated by upgrading the Jest ecosystem to version 30.2.0:

- **`abab@2.0.6`**: Removed. This was a dependency of `jsdom@20`. Upgraded to `jsdom@26` (via Jest 30) which uses native platform methods.
- **`domexception@4.0.0`**: Removed. This was a dependency of `jsdom@20`. Upgraded to `jsdom@26` which uses native platform methods.
- **`whatwg-encoding@2.0.0`**: Updated to `3.1.1`. While still marked with some warnings in certain environments, it is the current version used by the latest `jsdom`.

## Remaining Issues (Unresolved)

The following issues persist because resolving them would require either package overrides (which were prohibited) or upgrading to incompatible major versions of core packages (which would cause breaking changes).

### 1. `minimatch` ReDoS Vulnerability (High)
- **Affected Path**: `eslint > minimatch` and `eslint-config-next > eslint-plugin-import > minimatch`
- **Details**: `minimatch < 10.2.1` is vulnerable to ReDoS. `eslint@9` and `eslint-plugin-import` specify `minimatch@^3.1.2`.
- **Constraint**: Upgrading to `eslint@10` resolves this in the core package, but `eslint@10` is currently incompatible with `eslint-config-next@16.1.6` and `eslint-plugin-react`, causing linting failures.
- **Proposed Alternative**: Once `eslint-config-next` and other plugins officially support ESLint 10, the project should be upgraded. Alternatively, if `overrides` were permitted, we could force `minimatch@10.2.2`.

### 2. `ajv` ReDoS Vulnerability (Moderate)
- **Affected Path**: `eslint > ajv`
- **Details**: `ajv < 8.18.0` is vulnerable. `eslint@9` uses `ajv@6.12.6`.
- **Constraint**: `eslint@9` and even `eslint@10` continue to use `ajv@6` for configuration validation. This is a known state in the ESLint ecosystem.
- **Proposed Alternative**: This vulnerability is generally low-risk in a development-only tool like ESLint. It can be resolved only by a future ESLint version that migrates away from `ajv@6`.

### 3. `glob@7.2.3` and `inflight@1.0.6` Deprecations
- **Affected Path**: `jest > ... > test-exclude > glob`
- **Details**: `test-exclude@6.0.0` (used by `babel-plugin-istanbul`, which is a dependency of Jest) still uses these deprecated packages.
- **Constraint**: `babel-plugin-istanbul@7.0.1` still specifies `test-exclude@^6.0.0`.
- **Proposed Alternative**: Wait for `babel-plugin-istanbul` to release a version that uses `test-exclude@7+`.

## Conclusion

The project's security posture has been improved by removing several deprecated packages through a safe major version upgrade of Jest. Further resolution of remaining vulnerabilities is blocked by upstream package compatibilities and the strict requirement to avoid overrides and breaking changes.
